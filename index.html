      The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. "I have never yet been beaten," said he, "when I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one here to race with me."
      The Tortoise said quietly, "I accept your challenge."
      "That is a good joke," said the Hare; "I could dance round you all the way."
      "Keep your boasting till you've won," answered the Tortoise. "Shall we race?"
      So a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap. The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race.
      Then the Tortoise said: "Slow but steady progress wins the race."

      A Mouse running over his face awakened a Lion from sleep. Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him. Then the Mouse piteously entreated, saying:
      “If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.” The Lion laughed at him but allowed him go. It happened shortly after this that some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground, caught the Lion. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaiming:
      “You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, never expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor,  Now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.”
